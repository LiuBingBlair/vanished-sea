    <h2>Theory of Planned Behavior Example</h2>
A retail store has just launched its online store. While the intention is that people move from buying in-store to online, nobody is behaving this way. Let’s find out why.
<br><br>
A survey of existing customers, shaped by the Theory of Planned Behavior, is used to understand customer beliefs about online shopping. By asking a set of open-ended questions, the relevant barriers and attitudes become clear.   
<br><br>
<h3>1. Attitudes</h3>
In the survey, people share their attitudes towards online shopping. Some customers understand the convenience of shopping online, while others want to buy in-store rather than wait for delivery. Many of the store’s customers are older and believe it is not safe to use a credit card online.
<br><br>
<h3>2. Subjective Norms</h3>
Respondents say that their friends and family who have tried shopping online, have not had problems with making a purchase. Respondents noted that their younger friends actually prefer to buy online.
<br><br>
<h3>3. Perceived Behavioral Control</h3>
When asked about barriers to shopping online, many older customers shared that they find technology confusing, and this is preventing them from making a purchase. The survey also threw up some other issues:
<br><br>
Some people like to touch and inspect products before they buy them.  
Most people were not aware that it was possible to buy the store’s products online.
<br><br>
<h3>4. Intention</h3>
In the survey, many customers highlighted that the would like to use the online store but hadn’t done so yet simply because they found it all a little overwhelming and daunting.
<br><br>
<h3>Example Conclusions</h3>
Now the factors that influence customers shopping online are understood, what can be done about it?
<br><br>
To address the issues raise the store could:
<br><br>
Customers who create an instore account are able to register their credit card details. When making online orders, they no longer have to enter credit card details.
<br><br>
To help build awareness of the online store, in-store checkout clerks remind customers they can buy products online.
<br><br>
To bridge the intention gap where customers want to use the online store but find it overwhelming, the store offers people to have someone in-store walk them through the whole online process for their first online purchase.
<br><br>
By implementing actions to address all of the factors that influence behavior according to the Theory of Planned Behavior, the store should begin to see a noticeable uptake in people using its online store.
<br><br>
Although this example examines the theory from a business perspective, the model is commonly used in public health planning, for example, such as where you are endeavoring to encourage the population to eat a healthier diet.

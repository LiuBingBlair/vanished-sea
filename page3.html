<h3>Advantages</h3>
&#9830;The model is useful for making predictions. By considering the variables as inputs into the model, this provides more reliability in the prediction of behavior, particularly over the Theory of Reasoned Action. 
<br><br>
&#9830;Before risking investment in change, the model can be used to gather data to help you identify the biggest barriers to changing behavior.
<br><br>
<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
&#9830;There are situations where the model fails. While there may be a positive behavioral intention, the model doesn’t account for the gap between intention and behavior. You can extend the model with implementation intentions to address this problem. 
<br><br>
&#9830;The model does not include other behavioral factors like emotions. Emotions can impact our perception and our beliefs and tendency to take action.
<br><br>
&#9830;The model is great for finding the relationship of attitudes to behavioral intentions. It doesn’t address how to determine actions that result in changing behavior.
